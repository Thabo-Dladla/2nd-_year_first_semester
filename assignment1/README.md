# Assignment 1- Binary Trees & Generics (Java)

This assignment focuses on implementing **binary trees** and practicing **generics** in Java.  
It demonstrates understanding of data structures, object-oriented programming, and recursion.

## Files
**BinarySearchTree.java** – Implementation of a binary search tree with insertion, traversal, and search methods.  
**BinaryTree.java** – General binary tree structure.  
**BinaryTreeNode.java** – Node class for binary tree implementation.  
**BTQueue.java** – Queue used for level-order traversal of the binary tree.  
**GenericsKbArrayApp.java** – Application demonstrating generics with arrays.  
**GenericsKbBSTApp.java** – Application demonstrating generics with binary search trees.  

## Skills Demonstrated
Binary tree and binary search tree implementation  
Recursion and traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order)  
Enforced the use of generics in Java
