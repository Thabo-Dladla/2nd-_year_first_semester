# Assignment 2 - AVL Trees & Generics (Java)

This assignment builds on Assignment 1 by introducing **AVL Trees**, a type of self-balancing binary search tree.  
It demonstrates advanced tree operations, balancing algorithms, and the use of generics in Java applications. 

all the files are in the **src** folder  
  
**AVLTree.java** – Implementation of an AVL tree with insertion and automatic balancing (rotations) this was assingment was extending what we did in the first assgnment.    
**BinaryTree.java** – Base binary tree structure reused for AVL implementation.  
**BinaryTreeNode.java** – Node class for binary trees.  
**BTQueue.java** – Queue used for level-order traversal.  
**BTQueueNode.java** – Node class used within the traversal queue.  
**Experiment.java** – Test program for experimenting with AVL tree operations.  
**GenericsKbAVLApp.java** – Application demonstrating generics with AVL trees.
